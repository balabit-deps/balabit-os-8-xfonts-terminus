Description: Oblique version of the Terminus font
 This package contains oblique versions of the fonts in the package
 xfonts-terminus.  These fonts are automatically generated and at
 present are not supported by the upstream maintainer.  They have much
 lower quality than the original fonts.  Nevertheless they can be
